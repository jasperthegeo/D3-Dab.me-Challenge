          <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks, Age, Tobbaco use, and Income</h3>
          <p>High-income countries have greater rates of obesity than middle- and low-income countries (1). Countries
            that develop wealth also develop obesity; for instance, with economic growth in China and India, obesity 
            rates have increased by several-fold (1). The international trend is that greater obesity tracks with greater wealth (2,3).
            </p>

          <p>The U.S. is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and accordingly has high obesity rates; one-third of 
            the population has obesity plus another third is overweight. The situation is predicted to worsen; rising 
            childhood obesity rates forewarn of worsening statistics (4). While it is agreed that both individual factors 
            such as genetic susceptibility and behavior are important in life-long weight gain, evidence is ill-defined
            with respect to the nature of the environmental influences that impact obesity (5).</p>

          <p>In 2010, 15.1% of Americans lived in poverty based upon family income census data (6). With the 
            economic downturn, the number of people in the U.S. living in poverty rose to 46 million people—the 
            greatest number in more than 50 years (6).
